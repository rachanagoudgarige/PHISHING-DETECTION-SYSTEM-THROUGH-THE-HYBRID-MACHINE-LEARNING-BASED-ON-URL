# Phishing Detection System Through Hybrid Machine Learning Based on URL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project detects phishing websites using a **hybrid machine learning approach** based on URL features.
The system analyzes URL characteristics and predicts whether a website is **Phishing** or **Legitimate**.
